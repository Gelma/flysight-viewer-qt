# FlySight Viewer

## Libraries

1. FlySight Viewer should be built using Qt 5.5.1. Later versions of Qt do not include QWebView, which is used by MapView.
2. VLC-Qt builds can be found here: https://github.com/vlc-qt/vlc-qt/releases. For Qt 5.5, use VLC-Qt 1.0.
3. wwWidgets is located here: http://www.wysota.eu.org/wwwidgets/#download. For Qt 5 compatibility, wwWidgets must be built from source.
